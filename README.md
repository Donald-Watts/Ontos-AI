A one pager... (speak more after NDA)
Updates to this project are ungoing. Ontos AI-XRC is here. Thank you for your patence.

**Ontos AI-XRC**


A private, symbolic+semantic AI OS that learns and runs your workflows faster than you can explain them.

Local-first. Containerized. Model-agnostic. Built to kill workflow chaos and not to farm your data.

TL;DR (read this first)
Status: Live core as of July 26, 2025; persistent memory + GUI integrated Aug 1–2, 2025.

What it is: An operations layer (not a chatbot) that orchestrates your tools in real time with symbolic reasoning, semantic search, and persistent memory.

How it runs: 8 containerized services on your own hardware; sub-100ms endpoints on a modest box.

Why care: Privacy, speed, and zero vendor lock-in, is designed to outlast the AI-app hype cycle.

Access: By invitation. No public binaries. No screenshots. If you’re serious, talk to me.

What Ontos AI-XRC Does (without leaking the recipe)
Learns + orchestrates: Observes your patterns, coordinates tasks across tools, and adapts in real time.

Thinks in two modes: Symbolic (structure/logic) + Semantic (meaning/embedding) for reliable recall and control.

Remembers responsibly: Persistent memory with zone scoping and a clean GUI to manage it.

Stays local: Fully private, containerized deployment; cloud only if you explicitly flip the switch.

Swaps models: Model-agnostic core — not married to a single LLM or provider.



Short version: rails, not another cart.
What It’s Not
Not a wrapper around one API.

Not “yet another agent demo.”

Not SaaS-first. Your machine, your rules.

Current Snapshot (Aug 2025)
Services: 8 (containerized, private).

Performance: Endpoint responses < 100ms in core paths.

Validation: 100+ tests (internal), 100% pass on latest build.

GUI: Clean management interface for knowledge/memory; human-in-the-loop controls.

DSL layer: Templates for defining workflows (rolling out).

Hardware proof: HP ProDesk 600 G3 SFF (i7-6700, 32 GB RAM, Quadro P1000) — runs smooth.

Why Now (and why this survives the hype)


AI “apps” come and go. Infrastructure sticks. Ontos sits beneath the apps: an OS-like layer built for privacy, composability, and longevity. When the wrappers fade, the orchestration spine remains.

Architecture (high-level, on purpose)
Local-first micro-services (8) in containers; clean boundaries; stateless where possible.

Knowledge service with symbolic+semantic search and autonomous refinement loop.

Memory service with persistent zones, confidence scoring, and HIL controls.

Router / Executor / Agent mgr / Validation (PhaseSync) / Coordination loop (O-Xi) interplay for reliable task flow.

Model bus abstracts providers; hot-swappable backends.



(If you’re looking for diagrams or endpoints here, you’re in the wrong README.)

Security & Privacy
Runs entirely offline unless you opt-in integrations.

No telemetry. No “mystery analytics.”

Configs are per-deploy; nothing is phoned home.

Hardware & Deployment


Baseline that works today:

CPU: i7-6700 (or better)

RAM: 32 GB

GPU: Quadro P1000 (or similar)

OS: Linux/Windows with Docker-compatible runtime



Deployment: private containers, not public images.

If you want to run it, we’ll align on your specs and I’ll provide a sealed config.

Roadmap (safe edition)
Near-term: Expand DSL workflow packs; context generation; analytics.

Mid-term: Pluggable tool bridges; per-zone memory visualization; backup/migration.

Long-term: Developer SDK; enterprise policy controls; hybrid cluster mode.

FAQ (the short list)


Is it usable right now?

Yes — the core is live, fast, and stable. Workflows via DSL are rolling out.



Can I see a demo?

Yes, controlled demos only. No raw screens/recordings. I show just enough to evaluate fit.



Is this tied to one LLM?

No. It’s model-agnostic; swap or mix as needed.



Why no code here?

Because IP > clout. If you’re qualified and aligned, we’ll talk privately.



Can I run it on my machine?

If you meet (or exceed) the baseline specs, yes — via private containers + config.
