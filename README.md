A one pager... 
Updates to this project are ungoing. Ontos AI-XRC is here. Thank you for your patence.

## Ontos AI-XRC


Local-first. Containerized. Model-agnostic. Built to kill workflow chaos and not to farm your data.

## Read this first
Status: Live core as of July 26, 2025; persistent memory + GUI integrated Aug 1–2, 2025.

What it is: An operations layer that orchestrates your tools.

Why care: Privacy, speed, and zero vendor lock-in, is designed to outlast the AI-app hype cycle.

Access: By invitation. No public binaries. If you’re serious, talk to me.

(If you’re looking for diagrams or endpoints here, you’re in the wrong README.)

## Security & Privacy
Runs entirely offline unless you opt-in integrations.

No telemetry. No “mystery analytics.”

Configs are per-deploy; nothing is phoned home.

**Deployment:** private containers, not public images.

## Roadmap 
Near-term: Expand DSL workflow packs; context generation; analytics.

Mid-term: Pluggable tool bridges; per-zone memory visualization; backup/migration.

Long-term: Developer SDK; enterprise policy controls; hybrid cluster mode.
